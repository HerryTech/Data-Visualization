# Data Visualization

**Use Matplotlib to make simple plots** 

**Create interesting data set based on the concept of a random walk—a visualization generated from a series of random decisions.**

**Use Plotly to creates visualizations that work well on digital devices**

**Plotly generates visualizations that automatically resize to fit a variety of display devices**

**These visualizations can also include a number of interactive features, such as emphasizing particular 
aspects of the data set when users hover over different parts of the visualization. We’ll use Plotly to analyze the results of rolling dice.
